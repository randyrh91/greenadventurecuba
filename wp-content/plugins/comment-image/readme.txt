Enable readers to attach an image to their comments.

== Description ==

Comment Image enables blog readers to attach an image while leaving their comments.
Supported formats are JPG, PNG, GIF.

Uploaded images are inserted below the comment text as thumbnail (of configurable
max dimensions) and linked to the original pictures.

File selection field can be injected automatically or added manually.

Original pictures and their thumbnails are stored in a separate folder for easy
management.

See the official [Comment Image](http://www.satollo.net/plugins/comment-image) page for more.

An extended alternative to Comment Image plugin is my [Comment Plus](http://www.satollo.net/plugins/comment-plus)
plugin with much more attachment manipulation options (notification, held in moderation,
max stored size, watermark) and that integrates the features of [Comment Notifier](http://www.satollo.net/plugins/comment-notifier)
plugin.
